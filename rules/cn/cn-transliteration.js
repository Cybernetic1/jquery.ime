/**
 * An input method for the Cyrillic alphabet with palochka, which is used by many languages in the
 * North Caucasus region. Most keyboard layouts don't support this letter, so people frequently type
 * other similarly looking characters instead, but this causes various problems, for example when
 * automatically converting from uppercase to lowercase and vice-versa.
 *
 * This layout assumes that the standard Russian keyboard layout is used. All the rules produce the
 * same character palochka, and the characters used are the same that are often used by the speakers
 * of these languages online: 1. Latin small 'l'. 2. Latin capital 'I'. 3. Ukrainian capital 'І'. 4.
 * Alt-1 (the digit one). 5. Alt-д (Cyrillic small 'de', on the same key as Latin 'l'). 6. Alt-ш
 * (Cyrillic small 'sha', on the same key as Latin 'i'). 7. Alt-Ш (Cyrillic capital 'sha', on the
 * same key as Latin 'I').
